## Objective

The goal with the project is to create a lightweight framework and design system that can be leveraged for small businesses and their website needs. When a small business is putting together a website, there's typically little to no need for deploying a large framework that delivers a robust library and risks site performance. This framework serves as a simplified way to put together atomic elements and a structure that will satisfy most needs of a small business.
