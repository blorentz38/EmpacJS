## Objective

The goal with the project is to create a lightweight framework that can be leveraged for small businesses and their website needs. When a small business is putting together a website, there's typically little to no need for deploying a large framework that delivers a robust library and risks site performance. This framework serves as a simplified way to put together atomic elements and a structure that will satisfy most needs of a small business.

## License

There's currently no license associate with this project. This space is meant for experimentation until it's further developed. Once the project is far enough along, I'm open to attaching a license to it in the case others come along and want to leverage this framework for their projects.
